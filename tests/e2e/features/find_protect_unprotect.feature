# ⚠️ KNOWN ISSUE: Sensitive data protection may be inconsistent.
Feature: Sensitive Data Protection using protegrity_developer_python
    As a user of the protegrity_developer_python module
    I want to protect sensitive data from text files
    I also want to unprotect the data back to its original form
    So that I can do analysis on the data without exposing personally identifiable information (PII)

    Background:
        Given docker-compose.yml is up and running
        And protegrity_developer_python module is installed
