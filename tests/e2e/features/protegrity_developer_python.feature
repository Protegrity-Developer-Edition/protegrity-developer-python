# üö® IMPORTANT: There is a known issue where sensitive data may not always be redacted or masked as expected. As a result, the 'then' steps may not fail even if redaction is incomplete or inaccurate.
Feature: Sensitive Data Redaction and Masking using protegrity_developer_python
    As a user of the protegrity_developer_python module
    I want to redact or mask sensitive data from text files
    So that I can do analysis on the data without exposing personally identifiable information (PII)

    Background:
        Given python version 3.9 or higher is installed
        And docker-compose.yml is up and running
        And protegrity_developer_python module is present

    Scenario: Redact PII from input text using protegrity_developer_python module
