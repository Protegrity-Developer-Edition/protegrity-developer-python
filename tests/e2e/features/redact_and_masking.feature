# ‚ö†Ô∏è KNOWN ISSUE: Sensitive data redaction/masking may be inconsistent.
Feature: Sensitive Data Redaction and Masking using protegrity_developer_python
    As a user of the protegrity_developer_python module
    I want to redact or mask sensitive data from text files
    So that I can do analysis on the data without exposing personally identifiable information (PII)

    Background:
        Given docker-compose.yml is up and running
        And protegrity_developer_python module is installed
