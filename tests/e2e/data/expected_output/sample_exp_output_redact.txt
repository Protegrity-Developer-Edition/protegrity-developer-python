The customer reported their card number as [CCN], but they might need to check it again. During the verification process, we noticed [CCN] was submitted multiple times by mistake. Please ensure you replace the incorrect input [DATE] with valid data. I think [DATE] was listed in a previous entry, but double-check just in case. For reference, [DATE] seems to follow an old format; update as required.
